シナリオ読了想定時間：90分

The ice cube will melt as it sits on your desktop. You can put it back in the freezer now and then to keep it solid and extend its lifespan for as long as possible, or you can let it melt to collect the items inside.

Statistics will be tracked for various data points, including the lifespan of your longest lasting cube.

Items that have been collected may be displayed on the desktop as decoration.

At any time, you may get a new ice cube from the menu, with a new item inside.
